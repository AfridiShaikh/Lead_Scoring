# Lead_Scoring
Embarking on the project with X Education to enhance lead conversion rates is both challenging and exciting. Their goal to identify high-potential leads using predictive modeling aligns well with data-driven strategies for business growth.

The primary objective is to develop a logistic regression model that assigns lead scores (ranging from 0 to 100) based on conversion likelihood. 
This scoring system will enable X Education to prioritize their sales efforts towards leads with the highest probability of conversion, aiming for an ambitious 80% conversion rate.

We'll analyze a dataset of approximately 9000 leads, exploring attributes like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on the Website, and Last Activity to identify patterns associated with conversion. 
Handling categorical variables, including addressing 'Select' levels effectively, is essential for robust model development.

The project will culminate in a PowerPoint presentation showcasing the problem statement, analytical approach, and key findings translated into actionable business insights. 
Visualizations will play a vital role in communicating critical results and guiding X Education towards informed decision-making.

Additionally, a well-documented Jupyter notebook will demonstrate the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics, providing a technical perspective on the model's efficacy and performance.

Through this project, I aim to deliver tangible value by optimizing X Education's lead conversion process and providing actionable insights that drive business success. 
This experience will deepen my understanding of predictive modeling in real-world applications and refine my ability to communicate complex analyses effectively to stakeholders.
